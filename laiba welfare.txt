Our journey began in 2019 with a simple phone call from Ghotki Village, where a struggling man needed a helping hand. This single act of assistance set off a chain reaction that sparked the founding of the Laiba Memorial Welfare Foundation. By providing him with the tools to start a food cart, we not only empowered him but revitalized his entire community. This initial success inspired us to continue our mission of supporting underserved communities.

Established on April 5th, 2021, as a non-profit organization, the Laiba Memorial Welfare Foundation has since made a tangible impact. We've built wells, installed hand pumps, constructed houses, and are currently developing our first school. Operating with transparency, we ensure donors can see their impact firsthand through our detailed image gallery updates.

Today, we're expanding our reach through a U.S. chapter, inviting donations to further aid the underprivileged in Pakistan. Nearly 100% of your contribution directly supports our causes, ensuring every donation makes a significant difference.




WHAT WE DO

Access to clean water, education, healthcare, and basic necessities is a fundamental human right that remains out of reach for many. Laiba Memorial Welfare Organization (LMWO) is dedicated to narrowing these disparities by implementing sustainable programs for low-income and displaced families in Pakistan and the United States. Our mission is clear: to serve humanity through the provision of essential resources such as food, education, housing, and clean water.

Since our inception on April 5th, 2021, LMWO has focused its efforts in regions profoundly affected by natural disasters such as floods, water shortages, and landslides, concentrating primarily on Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Sindh provinces.

To continue our vital work in these communities, we rely on your support. Every contribution, no matter the size, has a profound impact. Your donation is guaranteed to directly benefit the program of your choice, ensuring it reaches those most in need. Together, we can forge a path toward a brighter future for underserved populations, fostering sustainable change and improving lives.
